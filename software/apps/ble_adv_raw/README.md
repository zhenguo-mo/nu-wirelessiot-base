BLE Advertisement Raw App
==========================

Example of using BLE advertisements with a raw buffer of data. Outputs
initialization steps through RTT. By default the BLE address will be
`c0:98:e5:4e:aa:bb` and the device name will be `CS397/497`.

Note that the device's BLE address must be unique among BLE devices in the
area. If you are programming multiple boards, change the `.device_id` portion
of the name.
